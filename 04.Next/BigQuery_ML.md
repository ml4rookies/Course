## Preface
In this section we will look at various ML techniques. One common element: they are all based and explained through structured data.
We are in a Google Cloud environment: we will use BigQuery, which is a paid service.
Fortunately in a completely free mode: **Bigquery ML Sandbox**.

We will review many of the concepts presented in the previous sections, but always using practical and real examples.
To increase engagement we will choose datasets of broad popular interest (surprise).

In more detail, we will see:
* Supervised Learning:
  * Regression, obviously.
  * Time Series Analysis (ANOVA)
  * Matrix Factorization (recommendations, like Netflix)

* Unsupervised Learning with K-means clustering

Finally we will deal with the **AutoML tables** and the import of **TensorFlow models**.

AutoML tables are important because different models are tested and he best one wins.
Amazing. Only one problem. Doesn't fit in Bigquery Sandbox ... (I need to find a solution).
